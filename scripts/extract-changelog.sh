# extract-changelog.sh — print the body of a CHANGELOG.md section.
#
# Usage:
#   extract-changelog.sh [--allow-empty] <version> [changelog-path]
#
# <version> is given WITHOUT the leading `v` (e.g. 1.2.3).
# changelog-path defaults to ./CHANGELOG.md.
#
# --allow-empty (must be the FIRST argument when present) skips ONLY the
# empty-body rejection. A missing section still exits 1 and usage errors still
# exit 2. CI uses the flag to assert the `## [Unreleased]` section EXISTS and
# parses — it is legitimately empty right after a release cut — while the release
# path (release.yml, `make changelog-check`) stays flagless so tagging enforces a
# non-empty section.
#
# Emptiness rule: a section body counts as EMPTY when, after IGNORING blank
# lines, `###` group headings (e.g. `### Added`), and HTML comments (both a
# full-line `<!-- … -->` and a multi-line comment spanning the line with `<!--`
# to the line with `-->`), nothing remains. Everything else non-whitespace is
# real content. This governs only the empty/non-empty DECISION — a non-empty
# body is still printed verbatim.
#
# Exit codes:
#   0  section found (body printed to stdout; with --allow-empty an empty body is OK)
#   1  section not found, or (without --allow-empty) the body is empty after
#      ignoring headings/comments/blank lines
#   2  usage error, or changelog file missing
#
# The release workflow (.github/workflows/release.yml) pipes this into the
# GitHub Release body, so a missing/empty section ABORTS the release — the
# human-authored changelog is the single source of release notes. The script
# intentionally avoids GNU-only awk/sed flags so it works on macOS too.
