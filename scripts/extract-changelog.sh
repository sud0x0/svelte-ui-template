#!/usr/bin/env sh
# extract-changelog.sh — print the body of a CHANGELOG.md section.
#
# Usage:
#   extract-changelog.sh <version> [changelog-path]
#
# <version> is given WITHOUT the leading `v` (e.g. 1.2.3).
# changelog-path defaults to ./CHANGELOG.md.
#
# Exit codes:
#   0  section found, body printed to stdout
#   1  section not found, or section body is empty/whitespace-only
#   2  usage error, or changelog file missing
#
# The release workflow (.github/workflows/release.yml) pipes this into the
# GitHub Release body, so a missing/empty section ABORTS the release — the
# human-authored changelog is the single source of release notes. The script
# intentionally avoids GNU-only awk/sed flags so it works on macOS too.
